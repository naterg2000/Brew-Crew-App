# Brew-Crew-App
An app that allows barista coworkers to connect. 

This app will have several features that are handy for a workplace but will also implement features that are beneficial to baristas specifically, as those are the targetted workers. 

A calendar features allows managers to upload weekly schedules so it is conveinent for workers to see upcoming shifts. Also, adding a feature to ask coworkers for coverage makes it less awkward and more efficient to get shifts covered. There will also be a feature allowing workesr to request days off and change their avaliablity. 

A group messaging feature allows management to quickly send important messages to the whole team quickly. Furthermore, workers can chat with each other for fun or for communications between each other to keep phone numbers private unless they choose to share them. 

Drink recipes can be added for baristas to quickly refresh on recipes. This is an improtant feature because people tend to forget recipes, causing inconsistencies in drinks, thereby decreasing review quality.

This app is designed to be an improvment from an app I used at work. Notifications were inconsistent, the app was not very user friendly and the calendar feature was not designed well. I intend to make an app that I would have loved to use.
